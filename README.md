# Spotify tool
This tool analyses spotify playlists, and can rearrange them based on the characteristics of songs in them. 
Analysis consists of finding the keys and modes of all songs in a given playlist, their popularity, and their valence/energy. These data are collected and visualised. Based on these characteristics rearranging is done by grouping similar songs together, creating a new playlist with better crossfading.
